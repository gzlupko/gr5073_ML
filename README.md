# GR 5073 Machine Learning for the Social Sciences 

This repo contains Python code associated with personal assignments for the course, GR5073 Machine Learning for the Social Sciences. Supervised and unsupervised techniques covered in the class include linear models, decision trees and random forests, dimensionality reduction models, and SVM. Methods also include feature engineering, resampling strategies, and imputation. Finally, ensemble models are explored and an introduction to neural networks and NLP techniques are covered as well.
